Array/String," Merge Strings Alternately"," ""Two pointers. Once one reaches end it will stop appending. Only when both reach end does the loop exit"""
Array/String,"Greatest Common Divisor of Strings","Get the smallest string's length. Use that to start iterator since the prefix can only be as long as the smallest string to be considered a prefix of both strings. Work the iterator backwards to check each prefix. If the prefix length is a factor of both string's length then it can be considered a GCD. Then multiply the prefix by some factor and see if that equals the string. If true for both string, then that is your GCD."
Array/String,"Kid with Greatest Candies","Get max of array, loop through array, on each element add extra candies, if that number is greater than max then push True otherwise False. In the end return array matching locations of kid's candies"
Array/String,"Can Place Flowers","In any given array of 1s and 0s, please return True or False if we can plant n flowers in any 0 where there is no 1 next to it on either side. The trick here is to use condition statements wisely. We can to combine the conditions that check the left and right of the current placeholder to check they aren't also the edge of the array. We can combine these two conditions with a join ""or"". This allows us to combine the edge of the array with checking the left/right of the current index. Afterwards we just indeicate that the current placeholder has a plant by setting it equal to one to make sure the next iterator does not overcount"
